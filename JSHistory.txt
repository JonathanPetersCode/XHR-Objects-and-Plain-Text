1) JavaScript was designed by Brendan Eich in 1995 for Netscape to allow developers to enhance web pages with things like animated drop-down menus, and validating form entries.

2) Brendan Eich designed JavaScript with the following in mind:

3) Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (an MIT textbook)

4) Incorporating Java-based syntax, object-oriented programming, and a prototypal inheritance system


5) The language was originally called “Mocha”, then 
changed to “LiveScript”, then “JavaScript”. It’s also now known as ECMAScript

6) JavaScript competed with, and quickly outpaced, Java applets in the creation of web pages.

7) JavaScript (or ECMAScript) has been through many revisions:
ES2 (1998)
ES3 (1999)
ES5 (2009)
ES6 (2015)

8) The 2017 GitHub "Octoverse" report puts JavaScript at #1 most used programming language, with 2.3 million GitHub repos (2.3 times as many as Python, the runner-up).
